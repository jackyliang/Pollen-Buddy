# Pollen Buddy
___

A small and experimental Java Wunderground Pollen API library.

___

*Insert better description here*

This library gets today's date, pollen type of each day, the city of the zip code you requested, and the corresponding data of each corresponding date to a maximum of four days [limitation of Wunderground's pollen predictions].

____


## Note

You can use this anywhere the MIT license permits. Please kindly credit me when you use this library, and if possible, contribute back patches when necessary.

Do not, I repeat, do **NOT** use this library in a live production settings! It uses JSoup to scrape HTML directly off of Wunderground's Pollen site, and Wunderground could tweak their HTML just a bit, and it would break this library. I am not responsible for you losing millions of dollars.
